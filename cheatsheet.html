                      It also helps to prevent errors of happening in the future if regular testing is carried out.
                      Automating testing of code Is also quicker as each piece of code doesn't have to be tested individually
                      it is also more effective as it helps to spot errors quicker and some you may not notice.

                    -there are two groups of types in javascript: <strong>Primitives</strong> and <strong>Objects</strong>. Any value that isn't a primitive type is an <string>object</string>

                    <br>
                    -The primitives are: numbers,strings,booleans, null and undefined. Everything else is an object

                    <br>
                    -<strong>Undefined</strong> means that a variable (or property or array item) hasn't yet been initialized to a value

                    <br>
                    -<strong>NaN</strong> stands for "Not a Number", although a better way to think of <strong>NaN</strong> is as a number that can't be represented in JavaScript.The type of Nan is number.

                    <br>
                    -Nan never equals any other value, including itself, so to test for NaN use the function <strong>isNaN</strong>

                    -Test two values for equality using <strong> ==</strong>or<strong>===</strong>

                    <br>
                    -If two operands have different types, the equality operator (==) will try to convert one of the operands into another type before testing for equality.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    -If two operands have different types, the strict equality operator (===) returns false.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    -You can use === if you want to be sure no type conversion happens, however sometimes the type conversion of == can come in handy
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    -Type conversion is also used with other operators, like arithmetic operators and string concatenation

                    <br>
                    -JavaScript has five <strong>falsey</strong> values: undefined, num,0,"" (the empty string) and NaN. (False is also falsey). All other values are <strong>truthy</strong>

                    <br>
                    -Strings sometimes behave like objects. If you use a property or method on a primitive string, JavaScript will convert the string to an object temporarily, use the property
                    and then convert it back to a primitive string. This happens behind the scenes so you don't have to think about it.

                    -The responsibility of the controller is to glue the game together, to make sure the players guess is sent to the model to update the state in the model changes.

                    <br>
                    -The responsibility of the controller is to glue the game together, to make sure the players guess is sent to the model to update the state, and to check to see when the game is complete

                    <br>

                    - To make it easier to create and test the model we intitially hardcoded tje locations of the ships after ensuring the model was working we replaced these hardcoded locations with random locations generated by code

                    <br>
                    - We used properties in the model, like NumShips and shiplength so we dont hardcode values in the methods  that we might want to change later

                    - Arrays have an IndexOf method that is simillar to the string IndexOfMethod the array indexof method takes a value and returns the index of that value if it exists in the array or 01 if it does not exist.

                    -Most JavaScript code is written to react to <strong>events</strong>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    -There are many different kinds of events your code can react to

                    <br>
                    -To react to an event you write an <strong>event handler</strong> function and register it. For instance to register a handler for the click event
                    you assign the handler function to the onclick property of an element
                    <br>

                    -You're not required to handle any specific event. You choose to handle the events you're interested in.

                    <br>
                    -Functions are used for handlers because functions allow us to package up code to be executed later

                    <br>
                    -Code written to handle events is different from code that executes top to bottom and then completes. Event handlers can run at any time and in any order: they are asynchronous

                    <br>
                    - Events that occur on elements in the DOM cause an event object to be passed to the event handler

                    <br>
                    -The event object contains properties with extra information about the event, including the type like click or load and the target (the object on which the event occurred)
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    -Many events can happen very close together. When too many events happen for the browser to handle them as they occur, the events are stored in an event queue 
                    (in the order in which they occurred) so the browser can execute the event handlers for each event in turn.

                    <br>
                    -If an event handler is computationally complex it will slow down the handling of the events in the queue because only one event handler can execute at a time

                    <br>
                    -The functions setTimeout and setInterval are used to generate time-based events after a certain time has passed

                    -The method getElementsByTagName returns zero, one or more element objects in a NodeList (which is array-like so you can iterate over it)
